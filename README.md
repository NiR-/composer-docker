# Docker image for Composer 

This is a simple Docker image for Composer, derived from the [official image](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/composer/) but with make installed. 
I did it mostly to be able to create new [Flex](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html#using-symfony-flex-in-new-applications) projects without PHP 7.1 on my host.
